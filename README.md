# Chatter Server (beta)
## a secure, privacy-based way of communicating over the open internet
---

Chatter is a way of communicating over the open-internet without needing to use something like a VPN.
It is completely terminal based and written in Python.

### Installation steps
- To setup this server, clone the repository via `git clone https://github.com/ii-Python/Chatter-Server-Beta.git && cd Chatter-Server-Beta`
- Then make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed and run with `python3 chatter.py`.

The configuration file is accessible in `config.json` and allows you to tweak the host, port, access code, etc.
For debugging purposes, a verbose mode is also available via the `-v` parameter.
